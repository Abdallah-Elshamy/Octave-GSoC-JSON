# Octave-GSoC-JSON
JavaScript Object Notationâ€‹, in short JSON, is a very common human readable and structured data format. Unfortunately, GNU Octave still lacks builtin support for that data format. Having JSON support, Octave can improve for example it's web service functions, which often exchange JSON data these days. 

This repo contains the code of my GSoC project that aims to support JSON decoding and encoding in GNU Octave.
